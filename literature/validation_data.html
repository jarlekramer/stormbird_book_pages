<p>This chapter contains useful references for extracting data about the lift and drag on different wind propulsion devices, that, for instance, can be used to validate a simulation setup. The most relevant comparison data are from methods that can be considered to be <em>higher fidelity</em> than the methods in Stormbird. In other words, the articles below mostly contain data from either CFD, experiments, or some type of processing of full-scale measurements.</p>

<p>The flow around rotor sails are defined by very high lift coefficients and therefore strong tip vortices. They often come with end-plates to specifically reduce the tip losses, and thereby increase lift and reduce drag forces. CFD simulations done on rotor sails in the KSP WIND project indicate that the exact features of the <em>tip-geometry</em> can have large impact on the final results. For instance, the foundation geometry can have a large impact on the forces. These types of geometric details will not be part of a simplified line model of a rotor sails directly. As such, it is <strong>generally necessary to tune the models to achieve the right combination of lift and drag</strong>.</p>
<p>Tuning the lift can generally be done by adjusting the values of the lift coefficients in the sectional model, as the 3D lift is generally very close to the 2D lift for a rotor sail. This is because the lift is not dependent on the angle of attack, in the same way as for a wing sail or suction sail.</p>
<p>The recommended practice when modeling rotor sails is to first adjust the model of a single sail by comparing it to some high-fidelity data source, and then use the Stormbird library when, for instance, interaction effects are of interest.</p>

One of the first papers about rotor sails.

Bordogna and more. Contains results from experiments where lift, drag and power coefficients on rotor sails where measured at different Reynolds numbers and spin ratios. <strong>Note</strong>: the experiments are performed in a wind tunnel where the rotor extends from the floor to the roof, which indicate that the force measurements should be interpreted as two-dimensional. However, it is mentioned in the article that there might be three-dimensional effects due to the boundary layer along the walls. The measured drag is also so large that there seem to be some three-dimensional effects present. The results are therefore probably most useful as a comparison for lift and power, while the drag values are a bit hard to interpret.</li>

<p>The KSP WIND project (the project funding the development of Stormbird) has performed CFD simulations of rotor sails as part of the project. These data are not yet published anywhere, except shown in the plots below. The primary goal of these simulations where to investigate the impact of the foundation on the lift and drag. The result indicate that the foundation can have a huge impact on the forces. A model that does not include the tip vortex on the bottom of the sails can, therefore, be overly optimistic.</p>

<p>Data from the original <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbosail">Turbosail</a> from Charrier et al. (1985) seem to still be the primary data source used in open research. The other papers above typically try to reproduce the same values, only with CFD. That is, the references mentioned do not provide new insight into the performance of the suction sail directly, but attempts reproduce the same values using CFD.  <strong>Important note</strong>: newer producers of suctions sails, such as <a href="https://bound4blue.com/">Bound4Blue</a>, <a href="https://econowind.nl/">Econowind</a> and <a href="https://gtwings.com/">GT Wings</a> uses different designs than the Turbosail, and claim better performance. The Turbosail data should therefore be interpreted as a <em>lower-estimate</em> on the performance of a modern suction sail. However, at the moment, we don't know about any <em>openly available source</em> that document this directly.</p>
